In this directory you will find the model weights and inferences for two problems:

1. Trigger Detection. Produces a graph-level classification, of whether the event is a trigger event or not.
2. Tracking. Produces an edge-level classification, of whether the edge candidate connects two hits from the same particle.

There are two model types that solve each problem. The graph-convolutional model (GCN) and the bipartite model (BP). Trained models of each type are provided for each problem.

Inference results are available in each experiment directory under the `inference_*/` directory. This has the inputs along with the outputs, allowing verification of model implementation.

Each directory has a `load_model.py` script, showing how to load the model and data loaders. Update the `model_results_folder` variable with the appropiate `experiment_*` directory. The script must be placed in `models/sPHENIX/tracking-GNN` to function.
